Well, I'm sure you've visited the rest of the site by this point. This is my first official site built using <a href="https://gastbyjs.org" target="_blank">Gatsby.js</a>, and I had a great time using it. I've helped set up a site in the past, I'd played around with templates, and I contributed technical documentation to the project, but I never quite finished my website. Started quite a few times, actually, and ended up moving back over to another project. Thus is the hobby of development, I guess.

Between my <a href="https://github.com/josefaidt/josefaidt.github.io/releases/tag/v1.2.1" target="_blank">old site</a> _(github)_ and this iteration, I had set up a couple different prototypes; much of which included Express backends with React and React Router v4, however in the end I enjoyed the ease of use of using Gatsby and Netlify rather than managing a server. That wasn't the only speedbump, though. Gatsby offered me so much out of the box including offline support via service workers, GraphQL for querying page assets, and most importantly a _blazing_ fast end product. If you're looking to rebuild your site soon, I can't recommend it enough.

I hope to continue using this blog as a space for me to talk about whatever I'm working on, tech, code, music, etc. Perhaps I will continue sharing bits and pieces of my work with Gatsby as I add new features to the site, or even my thoughts on web development in general.
